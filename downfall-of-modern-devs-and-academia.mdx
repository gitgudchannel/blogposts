# The Downfall of Modern Devs and Academia

There's a storm brewing, and it's one we can't afford to ignore. As we scroll through the annals of software history, a discernible decline punctuates the narrative. It's not just about the quality of software, though that's a significant part of the puzzle. The root of the issue? A complex web that intertwines over-academization, diluted credentials, and a looming reliance on LLMs.

The allure of the tech world has seen droves flocking to its gates. But with this surge, there's been an inevitable dilution. University degrees, once considered badges of honor, indicators of rigorous intellectual cultivation, now often feel like mere participation certificates. The essence of true learning, the spirit of inquiry, seems overshadowed by the rat race to secure that piece of paper. This phenomenon of over-academization has led to an influx of individuals who might be technically qualified but lack the depth and nuance that once defined a cultivated individual.

Echoing this sentiment, Oswald Spengler's insights on the cyclical nature of civilizations come to mind. He postulated that cultures rise, thrive, and eventually enter phases of decline. One telling sign of a civilization's wane, according to Spengler, is when its creative outputs start becoming imitations of past works, reflecting a stagnation of original thought and innovation. Drawing parallels to software development, a similar trend emerges. Rather than groundbreaking innovations, there seems to be a loop of rehashed ideas, signaling a potential stagnation in creativity and forward thinking.

But it's not just about the people. The software itself is feeling the strain. The decline is palpable, and if unchecked, we're on a trajectory that could see software quality dip to alarming levels. And the band-aid solution? Turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) as the crutch. While LLMs have their merits, an over-reliance on them could be our undoing. There's a very real risk of losing control, of handing over the reins to these models. Instead of developers dictating the terms, the tables might turn, with the machine setting the rules.

Imagine a world where the art of direct communication with machines becomes obsolete. A world where the nuanced dance of writing software is reduced to mere prompts to an LLM. The essence of software development, the joy of crafting code, might be at risk. There's something uniquely satisfying about manipulating text in Vim, executing a shell command directly on a selection with a simple !!, and seeing the immediate output replace your selected text. It's moments like these that remind us of the power and flexibility at our fingertips, asserting our command over the machine.

The implications are profound. If we continue down this path, we're not just risking the quality of software. We're risking the very essence of what it means to be a developer. The balance of power could shift, with machines not just as tools but as the puppet masters.

In wrapping up, it's clear that we're at a crossroads. The challenges posed by over-academization, the dilution of degrees, and the looming shadow of LLMs are very real. But with awareness comes the potential for change. It's a call to action, a reminder that while machines are incredible tools, the human element—the art, the craft, the passion—must always take center stage.
