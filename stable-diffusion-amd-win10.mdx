If you're on a unix-based system, this guide won't work for you, search for "SD AMD ROCm" guide instead. No ROCm does not work in combination with Windows Subsystem for Linux, at least I didn't get it to run with my AMD GPU.

### Watch my guide on YouTube instead:

## Dependencies & Preparation

Before starting make sure you have a decent AMD GPU, at least something like an RX480 with 8GB of VRAM or else you'll run out of memory pretty often or it may not even work at all (you'll just get gray pictures as outputs).

- You'll need a recent Python 3 version installed on your machine.
In this guide I'm using Python version `3.10.2`.

- You'll also need a [huggingface](https://huggingface.co) account as well as an API access key from the huggingface settings, to download the latest version of the Stable Diffusion model (1.4 as of writing this blog post).

- Make sure `python` and `pip` are defined in your PATH:
```bash showLineNumbers
> python --version
Python 3.10.2
```

- Open your Windows Terminal or cmd (as an administrator)

- Go to Harish Anand's _Diffusers_ repository, clone it into a folder you've created for this little project and pip install its contents. You'll also need ftfy and scipy, so pip install those as well:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harishanand95/diffusers.git
cd diffusers && git checkout dml && pip install -e .
pip install transformers ftfy scipy
```

- The trick that makes this work is to use the latest nightly build of Onnx. You can download it [here](https://aiinfra.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_artifacts/feed/ORT-Nightly/PyPI/ort-nightly-directml/overview/). Make sure the downloaded version matches your python version. In my case I have to download the file `ort_nightly_directml-1.13.0.dev20220901005-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl` since I'm on python version 3.10.2. Once you've downloaded it to your project folder do a:
```bash
pip install ort_nightly_directml-1.13.0.dev20220901005-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
```
Make sure you're *not using* the "dot slash" (`pip install ./ort_...`) relative path syntax here as this is a common mistake that prevents the pip install command from finding the local file because Windows has issues with forward slashes.

* Now you have to generate a Onnx version of the Stable Diffusion model. To do so run
```bash
cd ./diffusers/examples/inference
huggingface-cli login
```
and paste in your [huggingface API](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) token when prompted for it.
>If this step fails, you probably didn't accept the terms and conditions of the Stable Diffusion model yet so head over [to the model](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) and do so before retrying the step above.
Then run the `./save_onnx.py` script
```bash
python ./save_onnx.py
```

## Usage
There's the file called `dml_onnx.py` that can be used to generate your images. You can use as a reference or edit it according to your needs. At the bottom you can change the actual prompt, the seed, the output filename, the no. of steps, the guidance scale and so on.

If you want to change the default image resolution make sure that the widths and heights you choose can be divided by 8 and follow the instructions at the bottom of the `dml_onnx.py` file, such as re-generating a Onnx model for that new resolution.

#### Here's an example image that took roughly `2:30min` to create on my _AMD Vega 56_
