# An Unconventional Approach: Learning TypeScript Before JavaScript

Traditionally, JavaScript is the starting point for web developers. However, this post aims to challenge that conventional wisdom and make a case for learning TypeScript before diving into JavaScript.

## The Upside of Learning TypeScript First

TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, provides several benefits over JavaScript that can prove advantageous for developers, especially those at the beginning of their coding journey.

### Enhanced JavaScript with Static Types

TypeScript introduces static types, a feature that can significantly reduce runtime errors. With TypeScript, we explicitly define the type of each variable, enabling the TypeScript compiler to check for type-related errors.

```typescript
let isDone: boolean = false;
let decimal: number = 6;
let color: string = 'BlanchedAlmond';
```

### Advanced JavaScript Features Are Supported Out of the Box

TypeScript supports modern and advanced JavaScript features like decorators, async/await, and ES6 import/export syntax, which makes it a better choice for modern web development.

### TypeScript Promotes Bug-Free Code

TypeScript's static type checking catches errors at compile-time, preventing bugs that would otherwise emerge at runtime in JavaScript. This not only reduces debugging time but also encourages the development of more robust and reliable code.

### TypeScript Improves Code Readability and Maintainability

With TypeScript, code readability and maintainability are improved. Types provide clear expectations about the variables and function parameters, which aids in understanding the code.

```typescript
function calculateTotal(quantity: number, price: number): number {
  return quantity * price;
}
```

### Better Tooling

Due to static typing, TypeScript offers better autocompletion, type checking, and tooling for integrated development environments (IDEs) and editors. This drastically improves the developer experience, making it easier to write and refactor the code.

### Interfaces

Interfaces and types in TypeScript are similar in that they both provide ways to define custom data structures. While they largely overlap in functionality, there are some subtle differences that distinguish them.

Interfaces are designed primarily for declaring the shapes of objects, defining what properties and methods should exist on the object. They are excellent when you want to define complex, hierarchical structures, as they allow for a high degree of specificity.

They have many uses, including defining the shape of an object, acting as type aliases, and defining indexable types (see example below).

On the other hand, types are more flexible and can represent not just the shape of an object, but also primitive types (like string, number, boolean), union types, intersection types, mapped types, conditional types, and more. Essentially, types offer a wider array of possibilities.

However, for a newcomer to TypeScript, the distinction between interfaces and types is not overly crucial. Both are tools to achieve similar outcomes: better structure, increased readability, and enhanced reliability in your code. The choice between interfaces and types often comes down to personal preference, project requirements, and the specific use-case at hand.

As you delve deeper into TypeScript, you'll naturally gain a better understanding of when to use an interface and when to use a type. But in the beginning, don't worry too much about the distinction. Instead, focus on the benefits they both provide: clarity in your code, fewer bugs, and a smoother coding experience. Whether you choose to use an interface or a type, you're taking a step towards writing more reliable and maintainable code. And that's what truly matters!

```typescript
// 1. Defining the shape of an object
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

let john: Person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
};

// 2. Defining indexable types
interface StringArray {
    [index: number]: string;
}

let fruits: StringArray;
fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Mango'];

// 3. Acting as type aliases
type Dictionary = {
    [index: string]: any;
}

let person: Dictionary = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    address: '123 Main St'
};

```

### TypeScript Supports Generics

Generics are an incredibly useful feature in TypeScript that allow you to create reusable code which can work over several types. The concept of generics might be a bit tricky for newcomers, especially those coming from a JavaScript background, as JavaScript doesn't have this feature. 

Think of generics as a kind of variable for types. Just like variables in your code can hold different values at different times, generics allow your types to hold different other types. 

Consider the `ApiResponse<T>` interface in the provided example. The `<T>` is a placeholder for any type. This means that `ApiResponse` is a kind of object that includes a status (a number), a type (a string), and data of any type `T`. This `T` could be a string, a number, a custom interface — anything.

The function `handleResponse<T>(response: ApiResponse<T>): T` utilizes this generic interface. Here, the `<T>` again indicates that this is a generic function. The function argument `response` is of the generic type `ApiResponse<T>`, and the function returns a value of type `T`. 

This function checks the status of the response, and if it's not 200 (which usually stands for a successful HTTP request), it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the `data` from the response, which is of type `T`.

In the usage example, `userResponse` is declared as being of type `ApiResponse<User>`. This means that the `data` within this response is expected to be of type `User`. When `handleResponse(userResponse)` is called, the function expects an `ApiResponse<User>` and will return a `User`. 

This mechanism allows TypeScript to keep track of the types within your code, providing type safety and autocompletion, while still allowing for reusability and flexibility. It's one of the key features that make TypeScript a powerful tool for developing large scale applications.

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
    status: number;
    type: string;
    data: T;
}

function handleResponse<T>(response: ApiResponse<T>): T {
    if (response.status !== 200) {
        throw new Error(`Request failed with status code ${response.status}`);
    }

    return response.data;
}

// Usage:
let userResponse: ApiResponse<User> = /* some response */;
let user = handleResponse(userResponse);
```

### TypeScript Encourages Better Development Practices

TypeScript encourages developers to follow better development practices, such as favoring immutability and using pure functions. These practices can lead to cleaner, more efficient code that's easier to test and debug.

## The Aftereffect of Learning TypeScript First

After learning TypeScript and then transitioning to JavaScript, you might initially feel a bit lost. You may find yourself instinctively wanting to type your variables and getting frustrated when you don't get the same level of autocompletion and tooling support that TypeScript offers. An analogy I like to use is that someone who learned to ride a motorcycle before they learn how to ride a bicycle will at first struggle to maintain balance but in the long run, feel much more comfortable on a two-wheeler during speedy descents.

However, this discomfort doesn't last long. As you get used to JavaScript, you'll realize that your TypeScript knowledge has made you a faster and more efficient JavaScript developer. You'll know how to structure your code better, have fewer bugs, and spend less time debugging – all thanks to your TypeScript background.

## Conclusion

Learning TypeScript first can offer several advantages over the conventional approach. It gives you exposure to static typing, generics, and other features that TypeScript brings to the table. Though it might seem counterintuitive, there's no one-size-fits-all path in programming.

Are you ready to take the TypeScript plunge? The world of static typing, advanced JavaScript features, and better development practices awaits you. And remember, even when you transition back to JavaScript, your TypeScript skills will continue to serve you well.

Happy coding!
